Description of the car perceptor object in C++

----------------------------------------------
The car perceptor project/program is an assignment that was given in one of the classes i took in undergrad.
The goal of the project was to strengthen the knowledge in object-oriented programming.

----------------------------------------------
The project was written in XCode at the time and later on tested in VS Code. So far, it takes the information provided by the user.
It stores those information to later one build a complete information set to be displayed to the user. Although the program was completed,
i wanted to augmented the project and suit it to my own personal need that is to establish a payment plan with the corresponding interest.
Moreover, the plan will also take into consideration the any sort of change in the plan if that is necessary.

Side Note: Modify it to fit the actual need of an ongoing personal project
The development will track the payment plan of a given car object given its information such as the model, the year, the manufacturer, the total cost, etc...
After having those information, my program will attempt to create a payment plan and monitor that payment plan. Note that this payment plan will already include the interest, taxes and total cost. 
Side Note: Still need to see how to process that and adjust the program

Side note: Add APIs and create a database to store different prototypes 
side note
Also to be added to the project documentation is the fact that the whole project will run as a command line program rather than the regular mobile or web application with user interface

Side Node: This repo also contains scripts to program test encountered when prepping for interviews and sharpening skills in C++. Plus, I might also add some of the scripts in Python for reinforcement learning and machine learning project that i wrote in the capstone. The capstone is havving a RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent that learns from an environment, makes decisions, and see how the decisions are impacting the said environment.


----------------------------------------------

Side Note(main.py): Added a python script for getting pont movement in 3D and creating a gif/video of the movement over time. The code takes the different points locations in 3D and captures the different movement over time and then create a video/gif of the movement for the entire time being. The file containing the movement is a CSV file
